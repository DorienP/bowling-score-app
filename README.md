# Bowling Score App #

## Rules of the game :
1. Frames 1-9 allow two shots each (if you score a strike [X] you move to the next frame).
2. A Strike [X] is when you knockdown all pins in the first shot.
3. A Spare [/] is when you knockdown all pins in the second shot.
4. Frame 10 allows three shots so long as you score a 10 in the first two shots.
5. Highest Possible score is 300
6. Enjoy!

## Big Wins
1. It works!
2. Added extra detail of pins being knocked down.
3. Learned from mistakes early.

## Challenges Faced
1. Could have planned the sport into stages rather than having to refactor later.
2. Should have stuck with testing first, had all the cases thought out just rushed it in the end.
3. Math Algo for scoring system was very logical rather than mathematical, would like to refactor.

## Future Goals / Tech Debt
1. Adding a second scoreboard and two player names.  
2. Adapt bowling lane and pins into mini game with a bowling ball and simple physics.
3. Adding disable attribute to components.
